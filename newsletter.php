    <p>Now we are getting closer to summer, everybody can do more outdoor activities.
        Such as Tennis, Walks in the Park to feed the squirrels, Feeding the Ducks, trips to Coate Water.</p>

    <p>We are also planning a trip to Butterfly World. The Service Manager Carole often cooks a home made soup,
        every week on a Monday that hardly ever goes to waste as everybody enjoys it.</p>

    <p>We used to have a Fish Tank but sadly the Fish have all died, May they rest in peace.
        We have 2 members of Staff who have left the Team and will be well missed, but we wish them all the best.</p>

    <p>There was a Macmillan Coffee morning on the 20/4/22 held at XL Care which was nice.
        The food was very tasty and well prepared. All in all it was a very nice day and the weather was nice.</p>
